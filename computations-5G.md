## Introduction
**Frequencies proposed for 5G in the Netherlands are not beneficial for life 
processes in humans and nature.** This is concluded from analyses by Meier, 
Geesink and Kieft. Chosen carrier waves and accessory modulations of artificial
frequencies (for 3G, 4G AND 5G) do not match coherent frequencies beneficial to
life processes. This extrordinary coherent pattern of beneficial frequencies 
(alternated with unhealthy frequencies) was found indepedently by Thut and
Geesink & Meijer. **Hence, the Wetenschappelijk Platform EMF Netherlands are
proposing to add only beneficial, coherent frequencies to the 5G-Signal, 
composed of noncoherent and coherent frequency patterns, which do not 
reduce the effectivity of 5G-technology**

In this attempt for optimisation,  **three overviews of biologically 
relevant frequencies** were used: the recent literature study by Meijer & 
Geesink,
the computations by Walter Thut (inventor of the succesful water treatment
by Aqua4D) and the computations by quantum physicist Joel Sternheimer
(inventor of the Genodics techniques operating with protein music).

## Meier and Geesink
Let's start with the overview of life supporting and life disrupting 
frequencies by Meier and Geesink. See the diagram below. They analysed over 
700 scientific experiments regarding to the impact of ElectroMagnetic 
frequencies on fysiological processes. This concerns both singular and composed frequencies.

Measured frequency data of living cell systems supporting life (green dot clouds) can be summarised in an octave of 
12 tones. Frequencies harming life (red dot clouds) turn out to fit right in between. These biological effects have been
observed on external frequencies like endogenic effects, in living cells in vitro and in vivo. The spectrum of applied and
observed frequencies ranges from very low (Hz and kHz) to very high frequencies (MHz, GHz, THz, PHz).

Meijer & Geesink named this overview the 'Generalized Music' scale. This has not been done before and shows an original 
insight in the alternation of frequencies beneficial and harmful in the examined life processes. A relavant new insight added 
to the debates on the pssible effects of 5G on the health of humans, animals and plants.

## Walter Thut
Moving on to the comoutations by Walter Thut. The synthesys of Meier & Geesink turns out to fit into the frequency table of
**Walter Thut** seamlessly. He has worked upon the quantum principle that every mass also has its own frequency 
(the so called particle-wave duality, or mass-frequency duality). He computed the tones (i.e. frequencies) of all 
chemical elements in the periodic system. This resulted in the _Table with elements and molecules_ below. For every element
and its mass, and for several molecules and their masses, he computed the frwquency using the method of quantum physicist
Louis de Broglie. He combined the formulas E=mc<sup>2</sup>  and E=hf. Both formulas use the same energy contents E and 
hence can be equalised. This means mass and frequency are in a linear relationship. In other words: double the weight of 
an element and its frequency doubles. These computed frequencies varied widely, inducing his search for a handy overview. 
This became the ocave, known from music, which is also a play of frequencies. He is a guitar player so he knows a method of 
harmonic music, octaving. Every tone harmonises with tones of double or quadruple frequencies - so one or two octaves up, 
but also with tones with half or quarter of the original frequency. He halved (octaved) computed frequencies of elements 
and molecules until the fit within a diagram of a 12-tonal octave in the audible spectrum, between 250 Hz and 500 Hz. 
The figure below is the result of his octaving. Thut was completely surprised by what he saw: **All elements beneficial to
the human healthy body almost exactly match the frequencies of the 12 tones in an octave.** All non-healthy element, such as lead, 
are bordering healthy elements.

The original about Thut is that he then analysed **combinations of frequencies**. He thinks in terms of musical harmonics of 
whole numbers, i.e. standing waves that resonate in the same room. Like in music, clear accords like quint or terts 
sound harmonic in nature and they amplify each other. He also applies this discovery in his succesful DC treatment of 
water with frequencies of oxygen (in G) and carbon (in D) which form a quint together. His technique was succesful in 
tens of countries worldwide. Plants are better at taking up this water, also in saltish soil. 

## Table with elements and molecules

Thut starts his Harmonic Elements Table (HET) with base frequency G (384,9 Hz). For G is the tone of the elements
hydrogen and oxygen which are essential in biology. Also note water, H<sub>2</sub>0. G harmosises excellently with the 
tone D of the other essential element carbon, which forms carbs with H and O: C<sub>x</sub>H<sub>y</sub>O<sub>z</sub>. 
In this table, the tone A has frequency 432 Hz. Moreover, it is Thut's opinion that  the base frequency of A should be 
428,7 Hz instead of 432 Hz. This is the exact frequency of the electron being _most basic in life_.

### Comparison of the GM-scale and the HET-table.

Let's compare the GM-scale of Meijer & Geesink with the Thut's HET-table. Nearly every beneficial frequency Thut found
corresponds to a life supporting frequency Meijer & Geesink found in scientific literature. The table below lists both
frequency overviews. The very broad inventory of international publications by Meijer & Geesink and Thut's discovery, which
has yielded truthfulness in the succesful application of water treatment in agriculture, appear to match. This conclusion 
amplifies the credibility of both approaches. It also amplifies its relevance for the analysis of possible effects of 5G on life processes.

Geesink also compared Thut's HET to the GM-System (Generalized Music Scale). He too found a strong similarity: 
5 frequencies match exactly, 3 frequencies deviate about 1% and 4 frequencies deviate less than 1%.

Subsequently, Geesink sorts the optimal frequencies - the 12 full and halve tones - of both approaches starting with C, as 
is more comon with do-re-mi etc.  Colour choice of both approaches are also almost identical obviously, for these are the
12 base tones  octaved to the light spectre. See below.

Like Louis de Broglie, both methods are founded in Einstein and Planck's quantum formulas. Einstein's E=mc<sup>2</sup>
and Planck's E=hf. Again: a higher atom weight yields a higher frequency. Hydrogen atom H has weight 1.0080, 
oxygen atom O weighs 15.9994, hence O is 16 times heavier than the H-atom. (And 16 is the 4th power of 2, so the 
resonance frequency of oxygen is 4 octaves higher than hydrogen's, but musically it is the same note.)

The typical frequency of a water molecule, molecule weight M=18 g mol<sup>-1</sup>, is 54 Hz (resonates with tone A). 
Meijer and geesink position this typical frequency of a water mulecule central in their GM-scale. The mass-energy equivalence paired to the Planck-Einstein combination yields more exactly: 

Mc<sup>2</sup> = hf => f (Hz) = 2,981 x M (g mol-<sup>1</sup>). M is the molecule weight of water, c is the speed of light 299,792,458 m/s h is Planck's constant 6.62606959 x 10<sup>-34</sup> and f is the frequency of a water molecule.
