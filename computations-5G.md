**Frequencies proposed for 5G in the Netherlands are not beneficial for life 
processes in humans and nature.** This is concluded from analyses by Meier, 
Geesink and Kieft. Chosen carrier waves and accessory modulations of artificial
frequencies (for 3G, 4G AND 5G) do not match coherent frequencies beneficial to
life processes. This extrordinary coherent pattern of beneficial frequencies 
(alternated with unhealthy frequencies) was found indepedently by Thut and
Geesink & Meijer. **Hence, the Wetenschappelijk Platform EMF Netherlands are
proposing to add only beneficial, coherent frequencies to the 5G-Signal, 
composed of noncoherent and coherent frequency patterns, which do not 
reduce the effectivity of 5G-technology**

In this attempt for optimisation,  **three overviews of biologically 
relevant frequencies** were used: the recent literature study by Meijer & 
Geesink,
the computations by Walter Thut (inventor of the succesful water treatment
by Aqua4D) and the computations by quantum physicist Joel Sternheimer
(inventor of the Genodics techniques operating with protein music).

Let's start with the overview of life supporting and life disrupting 
frequencies by Meier and Geesink. See the diagram below. They analysed over 
700 scientific experiments regarding to the impact of ElectroMagnetic 
frequencies on fysiological processes. This concerns both singular and composed frequencies.
